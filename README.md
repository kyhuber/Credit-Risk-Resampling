# Credit_Risk_Resampling

This app evaluates the creditworthiness of borrowers for loans. First, the app reads in lending data from a CSV file. Next, the data is fit with a logistic regression model, which is used to calculate accuracy scores and generate a confusion matrix. Finally, the app resamples data from the regression model and draws a comparison between the oversample data.

The Credit Risk Resampling App creates value for the user by using machine learning to analyze data and predict outcomes.
